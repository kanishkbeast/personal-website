    <h2>What is Mathematics?</h2>
    <h3>10/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        I think we have all 'done' math.
        We may even have heard the notion that mathematics is the language of the universe. 
        Some of us may even use math in our day jobs. 
        So we have all been exposed to math in our life. 
        Personally, I am still not satisifed.
        I am not sure I can explain properly what the subject is. 
        Like, what even is a number? 
        I had this question for many years but never had the chance to go deep. 
        I finally stumbled on David Duetsch's Fabric of Reality where has has a chapter titled 'The Nature of Mathematics.'
        I think it does a good job in explaining what math is. If you have wondered the same thing as me, then you
        are in the right place. Let's take a dive.
