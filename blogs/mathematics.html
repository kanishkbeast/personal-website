    <h2>What is Math?</h2>
    <h3>10/23/24</h3>
    <p>
        We all learned mathematics in school.
        We may have heard the notion that mathematics is the language of the universe. 
        You may even use math daily in your job. 
        After 18 years of public education, 4 years of an engineering degree, and 
        several years of Kumon and RSM (ifyyk), I can say I have done a lot of mathematics in my life. 
        But I am still not satisifed because I am not really 
        sure I can explain what the subject is. For example, what even is a number? 
        To answer this question, I am going to start with David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality chapter on mathematics 
        and see if I can come to a satisfying answer. Will keep updating this blog post as I go.
