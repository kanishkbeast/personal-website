    <h2>The Self-Sufficient Human: An Ideal Way To Live</h2>
    <h3>10/16/24</h3>
    <p>
        The knowledge needed to survive today is different in nature than our hunter-gatherer past.
        We used to have the ability to survive alone in the wild. We knew which plants to eat and how to hunt. 
        Despite the alleged struggles of the past, I think we all took afternoon naps without feeling bad about it. 
        A stable food supply was not as guaranteed as it is today, but at least we used to be self-sufficient.
        As soon as civilization began, the knowledge needed to survive diversified because 
        just a few people (farmers) could grow food for entire cities.
        What was the rest of society going to do?
        People started to specialize with the goal providing goods and services others may need. 
        Out sprung professions such as craftsman, artisans, scientists, writers, and entrepreneurs. 
        This has lead to massive progress in all domains ranging from medicine to robotics to transportation, leading to collective prosperity.

        As a 23 year old man, I am grateful for the work that previous generations did for us. 
        I feel like I stand on the shoulder of giants. 
        Now, what does the future look like? How can we continue the improvement and live better lives? 
        I think a major issue in today's age is 9-5 employment. 
        First of all, it's hard to get a 9-5 job. I still can't get one after graduating almost 2 years ago with a engineering degree. 
        I think tradional employment has issues because it is routine based and makes life not fun.
        For those that have to do it because they have kids, I think it's fine. It is the most ideal way to live though.   
        If you force an animal into a routine, they become depressed and less vital versions of themselves. 
        Just look at the zoo animals. Most of us are living like that. We thrive in the wild, even if it is more dangerous. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I feel like we should all strive to be self-sufficient again (if we want it). I think this involves treating
        the free market like the wild, and honing your 'hunting' skills in it. 
        Even though it is more risky and higher stress, I just think this is a better way to live when you are not 
        tied to some 9-5 contract. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason why this is such a foreign concept is because they don't teach us this in school.
        They condition us to be obedient workers from kindergarden. 
        The truth is no human being likes bein told what to do, where to be, or what meetings to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I hope we can move back towards a place where each of us are working for ourselves again. How do we get there?
        I think it involves using the principles of engineering, design, mathematics, physics and creating abundance. 
        You don't have to force yourself to learn any of that. Let your own curiositiy guide you. 
        Once you are there, then apply these principles to build technology for people. Why technology? Because people 
        always want better and new things. 
        It may have to come through a 9-5 job to start, but I think over time, once we live in better abundance, then this will become less and less of a norm. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine if your town was a city-state that had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, automated transportation systems, and automated farms. 
        Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do, instead of waste time listening to obsolete paths society tells you to traverse. 
        I don't want us to be lazy. I envision us to all have the knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
        I want us to be Modern Day Jedi. 
        I want to get there. I want to help others get there. 
        Even if we just succeeded on one aspect of it, such as creating robots that do all of your housework for you, that would be great.
        This is why I want to work for a technological start-up or create my own company that can help make abundance for the world.
