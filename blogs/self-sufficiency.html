    <h2>The Self-Sufficient Human: An Ideal Way To Live</h2>
    <h3>10/16/24</h3>
    <p>
        The knowledge needed to survive today is different in nature than our hunter-gatherer past.
        We used to have the ability to survive alone in the wild. We knew which plants to eat and how to hunt. 
        A stable food supply was not as guaranteed as it is today, but at least we used to be self-sufficient.
        As as soon as civilization began, the knowledge needed to survive diversified because 
        just a few people (farmers) could grow food for entire cities. 
        What was the rest of society going to do? 
        People started to specialize with the goal providing goods and services others may need. 
        Out sprung professions such as craftsman, artisans, scientists, writers, and entrepreneurs.
        This has lead to massive progress in all domains ranging from medicine to robotics to transportation, leading to collective prosperity.

        I am grateful for the work that previous generations did for us and for the people that sacrificed their lives for us. 
        I feel like I stand on the shoulder of giants. My personal hero is Richard Feynman. 
        Now, what does our future look like? How can we continue to make improvements so our kids can have better lives? 
        How do we make our predecessors proud? 
        I think a major issue in today's age is that life feels unneededly hard despite all the progress we made. 
        I think it has to do with <a href="/prescriptions.html">prescriptions</a> that force us into forms of slavery we did not sign up for. 
        The biggest prescriptions of them all are mandatory education and the 'career.' 
        I an coming out of 18 years of school + 4 years of earning my engineering degree at a fairly competitive university. 
        Even after this work, it is not easy to get a job. So, I learned how to code, I started to write more on the internet, and I started
        to learn things on my own such as physics. 
        I am now seeing incremental progress and it only a matter of time before I can find an engineering job.
        I am wondering why I didn't just do this instead of going to college or wasting all those hours doing random extracurriculars in high school. 
        This also raises another issue, I don't even want a full-time job for the next 40 years. 
        It just seems like a mistake to spend that much of my life in a routine that I don't really have a say over. 
        I don't want someone to tell me what to work on, what to do, what to wear, or where to be. 
        I'll work for someone to the extent that I am learning, saving money, and working on a grand vision (such as SpaceX).
        But eventually, I want my own business or I want to have enough wealth to earn while I sleep. Or at least have the option to leave. 
        This is because I value freedom. I am a wild animal. I don't want to have a collar tied around my neck. 
        I am willing to work hard, but I am not willing to be under or even over someone, as both a burdens. 
        For those that have to do it because they have kids and obligations, I think it's a necessary evil. 
        Many people may even like their jobs, the people they work with, and their routine. For those people, I apologize for this blog post. 
        For me however, it is not the most ideal way to live though.  
        If you force an animal into a routine, they become depressed and less vital versions of themselves. 
        Just look at the zoo animals. Most of us are living like them. But humans thrive in the wild, even if it is more dangerous.

        I believe we should all strive to be self-sufficient again. I think this involves treating
        the free market like the wild, and honing your 'hunting' skills in it. 
        Even though it is more risky and higher stress, I just think this is a better way to live when you are not 
        tied to some 9-5 contract. 
        The reason why this is such a foreign concept is because they don't teach us this in school.
        They condition us to be obedient workers from kindergarden. 
        The truth is no human being likes being told what to do. It's human nature. 
        So I hope we can move back towards a place where each of us are working for ourselves again. How do we get there?
        I think I am slowly getting there and if I continue what I am doing, I will be self-employed in a matter of 10 years. 
        I think it involves learning the principles of engineering, design, mathematics, physics. 
        It involves learning writing and speaking. 
        Bascially, you become a mini-business. 
        You don't have to force yourself to learn any of that. I am finding that my own curiositiy is guiding me. 
        I am also finding that I want to apply these principles to build technology for people. 
        Why technology? Because people always want better and new things. It might be the best thing to work on. 
        And eventually when technology gets good enough, everything will be automated and we can have our time back. 
        And no, I don't think this will bring the end of the world. 
        Remember Covid? Many of us took a project that was the best in the world. We must be in the world. I am sure we all tried some random side project.

        Imagine if your town was a city-state that had it's own nuclear reactor, army of worker robots, automated transportation systems, and automated farms. 
        Imagine if you didn't have to go to work and you could use your free-time to do things you wanted to do, instead of waste time listening to obsolete paths society tells you to traverse. 
        I don't want us to be lazy. I envision us to all have the knowledge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
        I want us to be Modern Day Jedi. 
        I want to get there. I want to help others get there. 
        Even if we just succeeded on one aspect of it, such as creating robots that do all of your housework for you, that would be great.
        This is why I want to work for a technological start-up or create my own company that can help make abundance for the world.
